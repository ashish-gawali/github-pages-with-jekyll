This is my second first blog post. I am following a tutorial from github learning to create my website. 
It has everything I love. It is a tutarial designed by github so by default it uses version control. It allows you to go at your pace. And ofcourse you need to get to know some good version control practices and you are not ending up pushing everthing in "main" branch.
