So got some idea how github pages work with Jekyll. Now trying to set up a web page which will have my projects, resume and work experience.
Listing a few things I would like to achieve:
1. Create project pages with photos and videos.
    - A enhacement could be adding some description onto the page where the list is visible.
2. Upload resume.
3. Add work experience.
