<h1> 
  Siemens Digital Industry Software: July 2019 - Present
</h1>
<p>I am part of the Service Lifecycle Management(SLM) startup in the Manufacturing Division of DISW. In my time at Siemens, I have had the opportunity to work on various products and solutions. My first assignment was to work on an <a href="https://blogs.sw.siemens.com/service-lifecycle-management/2020/07/14/proactively-planning-for-asset-maintenance/">Asset Monitoring Application</a> which was developed using Mendix low-code application developer. As part of the team, I worked on integrating Teamcenter with the Asset Monitoring Application, which also included designing the system as well as contributing to the data model. I then went on the work with a team that was responsible for integrating the SLM offerings with IBM Maximo. To integrate both systems IBM AppConnect was used. Furthermore, I was also part of the team that developed a microservice for Asset Management. As I worked on different solutions in a limited period I was able to pick up working knowledge of AppConect API development, Mendix development, Java, JavaScript.</p>
