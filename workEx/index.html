        Monitoring Application </a>which was developed using Mendix low-code application developer. As part of the team,
      I
      worked on integrating Teamcenter with the Asset Monitoring Application, which also included designing the system
      as
      well as contributing to the data model. I then went on the work with a team that was responsible for integrating
      the
      SLM offerings with IBM Maximo. To integrate both systems IBM AppConnect was used. Furthermore, I was also part of
      the team that developed a microservice for Asset Management. As I worked on different solutions in a limited
      period
      I was able to pick up working knowledge of AppConect API development, Mendix development, Java, JavaScript.
